                <p class="text_about"> I am a passionate computer science student at the Kapodistrian University of Athens, Greece. With a keen interest in cutting-edge technologies, I aspire to pursue higher education and build a career in the fascinating realms of Machine Learning, AI, and Robotics.
                    I'm currently immersed in a challenging and rewarding computer science program, with one more year to go before graduation. 
                    My curiosity is piqued by the realm of autonomy, where machines and systems operate intelligently and independently. Exploring the intricacies of autonomy aligns with my belief that technology has the potential to solve complex problems and reshape the future.

                    <p class="descr">
                        Aimed to enhance the xv6 operating system by implementing a priority-based process scheduling algorithm. This project was part of my coursework in operating systems, where the goal was to explore and
                        modify the xv6 codebase for improved system efficiency.
                    </p>
                    <p class="descr">I worked independently and implemented two new system calls and the priority scheduling algorithm seamlessly into the existing xv6 codebase.Throughout the process, I gained a deeper understanding of operating systems concepts, C programming, and the intricacies of modifying complex codebases.
